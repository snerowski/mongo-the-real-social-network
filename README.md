# mongo-the-real-social-network

## Description
A simple api for a social network that allows the user to create users find users, make thoughts and delete friend, thoughts or their own account!

## Installation
Go to my GitHub account (github.com/snerowski) find the mongo-the-real-social-network repo, clone it to the terminal then run npm install!

## Usage 
After the user has installed the API in the terminal, they need to run `npm run start` in the terminal. Then navigate to insomnia and enter the localhost URL with the correct API routes and they will be displayed! I couldnt get the Delete requests to work, and also I had to change all of the required fields to false.
